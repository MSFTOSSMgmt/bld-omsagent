#Contributing

### Setup
- Fork the repository recursively to get the submodules:<br>```git clone --recursive git@github.com:MSFTOSSMgmt/bld-omsagent.git```
- If you are contributing in a submodule (dsc, omi, omsagent, opsmgr, pal) chekout the *develop* branch since it is where active development is being made:<br>```git fetch; git checkout develop```
- From the develop branch, create a feature branch where you will add your contribution.<br>
  By convention, for feature branch names, we use the format ```<username>-<feature_name>```<br>
  ```git checkout -b <branch-name>```
- Use of 'git rebase' is suggested to keep feature branches up to date. This works
  much better if you issue the following configuration changes to git's global configuration:
```
 git config --global rerere.enabled true
 git config --global rerere.autoUpdate true
```
 See [rerere documentation] (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere) and
 [rebasing documentation] (https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
 for further details.

### Code
- Make the changes as needed, test them out
- Commit the changes:
```shell
  git add <changed files>
  git commit -m "commit message"
```
- Push the changes to the server:<br>```git push```

### Review
- On [GitHub](https://github.com/MSFTOSSMgmt/bld-omsagent), create a new pull request.
That page should only show your changes. Be sure there is a relevant subject for the
pull request. In the details, include the line "@MSFTOSSMgmt/omsdevs" and any other
comments relevant for the reviewers.
- If you need to make new changes based on review, you can just update your branch with further commits and ask for additional reviews.
- Reviewers can sign off by leaving a comment on the *conversation* tab of the pull request.

### Merge
Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be merged to the develop branch. While github
itself can perform the merge easily, it uses the `--no-ff` option (no fast-forward), resulting
in somewhat messy git logs. As a result, we do not suggest use of github for merging your
changes. Instead, we recommend use of the command line.

- Merge latest changes to your feature branch from development branch:
```
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase develop
```
<br>Resolve any merge conflicts that may be necessary. If changes are necessary,
be certain to commit them to your feature branch.
- Go to the development branch:<br>```git checkout develop```
- Merge your changes to the development branch:<br>```git merge <branch-name>```
- Push the merge to github:<br>```git push```

### Cleanup
You should clean up your old branches. To do so:
- Delete remote branch:<br>```git push origin --delete <branch-name>```
- Delete local branch:<br>```git branch -d <branch-name>```

### Useful Commands

#### Managing submodules
From the base directory it is easy to manage all the submodule with these commands:

```shell
# Switch to the develop branch
git submodule foreach git checkout develop
# Pull latest changes
git submodule foreach git pull
# Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches
git submodule foreach git remote prune origin
# Show all the branches
git submodule foreach git branch -vv
```
